# qt4-action-editor
A port of qq14-actioneditor from Qt Quarterly to Qt4

There was an interesting issue of Qt Quarterly way back when which demonstrated 
how to make an application wide shortcut editor. Unfortunately the code was 
Qt3 only. So, I decided to port it to Qt4 in case someone might find it useful.
